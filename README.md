# safepickle
Deliberately restricted pickling library for Scala

Extra TODOs:
- Check the return value of Reader.read() in (most? all?) calls
- Performance tests
- Write readme
- Add test for manually written picklers being used as implicits by autogenerated ones, and vice versa
- Need to add pickler for BSON DateTime, but what type to use?
- Add picklers for ByteString and for joda-time types
- How to deal with explosion of module-per-dependency?
