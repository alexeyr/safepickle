# safepickle
Deliberately restricted pickling library for Scala

Extra TODOs:
- Check the return value of Reader.read() in (most? all?) calls
- Performance tests
- Write readme
- Finish writing Autogen tests
- Write and test generic-backend serialization for specific ReactiveMongo types that are serialized as primitives in BSON
- Add test for manually written picklers being used as implicits by autogenerated ones, and vice versa
