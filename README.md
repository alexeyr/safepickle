# safepickle

A deliberately restricted pickling library for Scala. It has certain features, and deliberately lacks others, because it is tailormade for a particular scenario I needed. Most people will prefer general purpose libraries such as scala-pickling, upickle, or rapture, but this one is optimized for the following goals:

 1. Security. Serialized input can be generated by untrusted sources. Deserialization must not instantiate unexpected classes, take unpredictable amounts of space or time, or produce values not of the expected type. The set of serializable types, and the code that serializes them, is determined at compile time, and runtime reflection is never used.
 2. Certain changes to the definitions of serialized types are guaranteed to be backward and forward compatible, so different versions of the program can communicate, and serialized data can be used for long term storage.
 3. Backward incompatible changes can be managed explicitly, with version numbers and conversion code, allowing new code to read data written by old code, and old code to fail on encountering data written by new code.
 4. Serialized clases correspond directly to the serialized form (at least for JSON and BSON), making it easy to write classes to represent data whose main schema definition is written in terms of the serialized format.

The library is also small enough to understand and validate by hand, and to make sure its performance is driven by that of the backend used (e.g. Jackson for JSON).

## Introduction to the main types

`safepickle` supports multiple backends which write data in different formats and using different implementations. It comes with a backend for JSON that uses Jackson and another for BSON that uses ReactiveMongo, and more can be added.

Every backend is required to support reading and writing these primitive types:
 
 * Boolean, String, Null
 * Int, Long, Float, Double
 * Array: a sequence of values of any types
 * Object: a map of strings to values of any types

A particular backend might support more primitives. For instance, BSON supports Binary (i.e. Array[Byte]) as a primitive type, but JSON doesn't. Other types are written as objects or arrays using primitive types.

A backend is declared by implementing `trait PicklingBackend`, which defines the types used (e.g. that JSON serializes to a String), and provides a factory for Readers and Writers.

Implementations of `trait Reader` and `trait Writer` provide low-level access to reading and writing a sequence of primitive values in a particular backend. Users of `safepickle` normally don't interact directly with these interfaces, except for manually implementing Picklers.

The high-level trait for pickling looks like this (this is a simplified version):

```
trait Pickler[T, -Backend <: PicklingBackend] {
  def pickle(t: T, writer: Writer): Unit
  def unpickle(reader: Reader): T
}
```

A `Pickler` can read and write values of a type `T` to a particular `PicklingBackend`. This second parameter is important, because the same type might be written in different ways to different backends. For instance, an `Array[Byte]` might be written as the primitive Binary type to a BSON-based backend, and as a base64-encoded string to all other backends.

That is why the `Backend` type parameter is contravariant: if you can write to a particular backend, that doesn't mean you can write to all backends. But if you can write to the `PicklingBackend` type, you can write to any backend. This also allows implicit resolution to pick the most specific pickler available for your backend.

## Supported values for serialization.

The primitive values corresponding to the above list (Boolean, String, Int, Long, Float, Double, and Null) are serialized directly as such.

An `Array[Byte]` is serialized as a base64 string, but some backends override this with, e.g. BSON-based backends have a dedicated Binary type.

Values of type `Iterable[T]`, where T is any supported type, are serialized as Arrays. This includes all kinds of `Iterable`s, including `Set`s, as well as `Array[T]`, which isn't natively an `Iterable[T]`.

Tuples of supported types.

`Map`s are serialized as arrays, where each key-value pair is serialized as an array of size 2. However, as a special case, `Map`s with String keys are serialized as Objects.

Objects are serialized as strings whose value is the object's (non fully qualified) name.

Classes are serialized as Objects whose attributes correspond to the values of the class's main constructor arguments.

Case objects and case classes behave the same way as ordinary objects and classes.

Finally, a `sealed trait T` is serialized as whichever of its (immediate) descendants is actually present. If that results in an Object, it will have an extra attribute named `$type`, equal to the class's name. This is known as the type tag, and tells the deserializer which value to instantiate. If serialization results in a String, because the concrete descendant of `trait T` is an object or a class with zero parameters, then the value of the string provides this service.

## Serializing classes

Picklers for classes are generated using the `Autogen` macro. The class must obey these requirements:

 * The primary constructor (the one that's written as part of the `class` definition) must have no more than one parameter list.
 * The primary constructor must be public.
 * The primary constructor's parameters must be of types that have implicit Picklers available.
 * The primary constructor's parameters must be declared as public `val`s or `var`s (using a case class does this by default).

Autogenerated class picklers have some special behaviors, designed to allow the compatible changes to class declarations that are listed in another section.

 1. If the class's primary constructor has no parameter lists, or a single empty parameter list, it's not serialized as an Object, but as a String whose value is the name of the class, the same as a Scala `object`.
 2. When unpickling, the order of the serialized Object's attributes doesn't have to correspond to the order of the constructor parameters. However, the `$version` attribute (if present) must come first.
 3. When unpickling, attributes with unexpected names are discarded.
 4. When unpickling, if a constructor parameter with a declared default value is missing a serialized value, the default value will be used instead. However, when pickling, all values are written out, even if they are equal to the declared default value.
 5. Class parameters of type `Option[T]` are serialized as follows: for `Some[T]`, the `T` value is written directly; for `None`, no attribute is written at all. This allows making an existing class parameter optional, which is a common change.

## Types not supported out of the box

It's always possible to write a Pickler manually for any unsuppored type.

 * Classes whose primary constructor has more than one parameter list, or is not public
 * Classes whose primary constructor has a parameter whose type isn't serializable
 * Iterables whose static member type isn't serializable (there's no Pickler available for it)

## Compatible type changes

As long as all object and class picklers used are created by the `Autogen` macro, or are written to be compatible with the above rules, the following changes to Scala definitions will be backward and forward compatible, so that different code versions will be able to exchange data.

Because the compatibility is bidirectional, each of these cases implies the reverse transformation is also compatible.

 1. These are all interchangeable: `object O`, `class O` and `class O()`. Also, case and non-case objects and classes are interchangeable.
 2. A class parameter can be added (at any position), if it has a default value declared. A parameter can be removed (from any position), if it previously (always) had a default value declared. When code with the parameter declared unpickles data without it, it uses the default value. When code without the parameter declared unpickles data with it, it ignores it.
 3. The declared default value of a parameter can be changed.
 4. The order of parameters can be changed freely.
 5. Any sequence type (`Iterable[T]` or a subtype of it) can be replaced with any other sequence type with the same member type. E.g., `List[Int]`  can be replaced with `Vector[Int]`. This includes `Set`s and `Map`s, but not `Map`s whose key type is String, because those are serialized as Objects and not as Arrays. (If a non-Set sequence type is replaced with a Set, when unpickling, duplicate values will be discarded.)
 6. Only in a class parameter type, `T` can be replaced with `Option[T]`, as long as the non-optional `T` has always had a default value. (Recall that, for class parameters, `Option[T]` is written as a `T` or omitted entirely if the value was `None`.)
 7. Numeric types can be replaced with wider ones: Int with Long, and Float with Double. If code with a narrow type declared reads data with a wide value that doesn't fit, it will be truncated (Long -> Int) or rounded (Double -> Float).
 8. A sequence member type, or a map key or value type, can be replaced with another type, if the two types are compatible according to these rules. For instance, `List[List[Int]]` can be replaced with `Vector[Set[Long]]`.

Extra TODOs (will be moved to tickets):
- Check the return value of Reader.read() in (most? all?) calls
- Performance tests
- Add test for manually written picklers being used as implicits by autogenerated ones, and vice versa
- Need to add pickler for BSON DateTime, but what type to use?
- Add picklers for ByteString and for joda-time types
- Autogen for sealed traits should ensure no two descendants share the same local name
- Add conversions between Int-Long and Float-Double, as compatible changes
- Test autogen of sealed trait extended by sealed trait extended by class
- Document backend.picklers cake and add usage examples to readme
- Replace the word 'serialization' with 'pickling' everywhere
- Support tuples of all sizes
